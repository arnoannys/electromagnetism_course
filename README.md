# electromagnetism_course
Jupyter notebook and matlab codes demonstrating basic principles of electromagnetism for students of AFIII: electromagnetism at the University of Antwerp

It contains the simulation of the fields around a homogeneously charged insulating plate, the fields around a dipole, shielding of fields by a metallic enclosure, ...

The easiest thing to use these notebooks is to open them in Binder where they will run from any browser on a cloud machine. No setting up and very light on your own hardware:

Alternatively you could install Anaconda (pc, mac, linux...), download the notebooks and run them on your own platform. This is great if you want to change the code more extensively and start making your own notebooks.
